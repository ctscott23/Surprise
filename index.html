        <!-- Summary -->
        <p>Baby, I don't even know where to start.  <p>Baby, I don't even know where to start. You have been my rock, my shoulder to cry on, my hero, my teacher, my partner, all the things most people strive for in a lifetime. I can't even describe what you have done to me and how you have made me feel because it is something so alien to me. Your patience is unmatched, putting up with all my shit and your kindness and personality shine so bright it brings light to all cracks and crevices of negativity within me. <--(that was straight off the dome!) but its so true baby, i could go on and on about what you have done for me in only a year, i cannot fathom what an eternity together brings. I know you are my soulmate, my person. Everyday is an adventure and a lesson blanketed with love and nurturing that i have only felt from the most important women in my life. I believe whole-heartedly that you were a glitch in the matrix maybe my mom and my grandma got together and said this boy needs some structure in his life and that is what you are giving me, i hope you know that. </p>

        <p>Alot of times i know you feel like I'm a lost cause even though you would never admit that and well quite frankly, you probably dont believe that at all because of the person you are. You see beauty in most, and take life as it comes. Well, except maybe when youre driving lmao i dont even know what happens *performs exorcism* but even then at least i know you have SOME anger in you that comes out from time to time and that reassures me that youre tougher than you and any of us think. I love you with all my heart, Paola. I will be there for you and with you until the end of time and then some. I have had the best year with you and have learned and grown so much. I can't imagine living life without you. All i need is your "hi my love" for the rest of my life and i will be set for happiness. Here's to a year and a gazillion more my sweet angel. TE AMO MUCHO MUCHO MUCHO MUCHO <3<3<3</p>
